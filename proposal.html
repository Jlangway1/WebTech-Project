    <h1>Justin's Project Proposal!</h1>
    <hr />
    <ol>
      <li>
        My project will be a webpage for the Leo J Martin Golf Association
      </li>
      <li>
        The objective of my website will be to attract new golfers and bring
        more interest into the sport of golf.
      </li>
      <li>
        The target audience would be Babson students who are interested in
        playing golf. It is open to all levels of play and ranges from someone
        who has never played to advanced golfers.
      </li>
      <li>
        I plan to include a page about the founders, a page with images of the
        courses, a page about how to sign up, a page about past winners, and a
        lessons page.
